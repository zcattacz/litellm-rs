## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Provider Infra**: `BaseConfig::for_provider` now consults Tier-1 provider catalog defaults first, reducing duplicated base URL definitions while preserving existing fallback behavior.
- **Provider Infra**: Removed the unused `CommonProviderConfig` duplicate from `core::providers::shared`, keeping provider base config responsibilities centralized in `core::providers::base` and reducing schema duplication.

### Added
- **Provider Tests**: Added B1 batch coverage to validate `aiml_api`, `anyscale`, `bytez`, and `comet_api` selectors and creation paths resolve through Tier-1 catalog to `OpenAILike` providers.
- **Provider Tests**: Added B2 batch coverage to validate `compactifai`, `aleph_alpha`, `yi`, and `lambda_ai` selector and creation paths resolve through Tier-1 catalog to `OpenAILike` providers.
- **Provider Tests**: Added B3 batch coverage to validate `ovhcloud`, `maritalk`, `siliconflow`, and `lemonade` selector and creation paths resolve through Tier-1 catalog to `OpenAILike` providers.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Agent Coordinator**: New `core::agent` module for managing concurrent agent lifecycles with cancellation, timeouts, and stats.
- **Utilities**: Added `utils::event` publish/subscribe broker and `utils::sync` concurrent containers.

### Changed
- **Providers**: Migrated `ai21`, `amazon_nova`, `datarobot`, and `deepseek` to pooled HTTP provider hooks.
- **HTTP Client**: Standardized pooled client usage and shared client caching across core/providers.
- **Routing**: Refined provider routing and OpenAI-compatible request/response handling.

### Fixed
- **Auth Context**: Corrected user/api-key context propagation in auth routes and middleware.
- **SSRF Validation**: DNS resolution failures no longer hard-fail SSRF checks while preserving IP safety.
- **Observability**: Prometheus label handling now safely maps provider identifiers.
- **Concurrency**: Event broker handles zero capacity; VersionedMap retry now guarantees progress under contention.
- **Packaging**: Track core cache sources and add root README for crates.io.
