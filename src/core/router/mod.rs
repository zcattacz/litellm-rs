//! Core router for AI provider management and request routing
//!
//! This module provides intelligent routing, load balancing, and failover
//! across multiple AI providers.
//!
//! ## Module Structure
//!
//! The router is organized into modular components following the single-responsibility principle:
//!
//! - `config` - Router configuration and routing strategy definitions
//! - `error` - Error types and cooldown reasons
//! - `fallback` - Fallback configuration and execution results
//! - `deployment` - Deployment management and health tracking
//! - `unified` - Core Router struct and deployment management
//! - `selection` - Deployment selection logic
//! - `strategy_impl` - Routing strategy implementations
//! - `execution` - Execution helpers and error conversion
//! - `execute_impl` - Execute methods with retry and fallback support
//! - `gateway_config` - Gateway configuration integration
